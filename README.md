# bow

A colour picker with a simple contrast preview

## install

Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) then run `bow.ahk`
(recommended)

or

Grab the latest bow.exe from
[releases](https://github.com/phantomdiorama/bow/releases/) (may be
outdated)

## usage

On startup Bow sits in the system tray. Press `win + middleclick` (or `win
+ leftclick` on a laptop) to capture the colour under the cursor and add
it to the clipboard (in hex format).

The GUI windowâ€™s background shows the selected colour, and previews the
contrast against black and white text (see screenshot). Hit the x to close
it.
